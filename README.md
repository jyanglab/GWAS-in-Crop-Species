# GWAS-in-Crop-Species
Simulate and compare GWAS power in different speices under vairous situations including number of QTNs, effect values, and heritability. 
We collected several crop spieceis genotype data from published paper:
- *[Sorghum bicolor](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/6/e1400218.short)*
  - including **1,943** georeferenced landraces and **404,627** SNPs
  - Genotyping-by-sequecing with 23% having MAF < 0.01 and 65% of SNPs having MAF < 0.1.
- *[Setaria italica](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n8/abs/ng.2673.html)*
  - including **916** diverse varieties and **726,080** SNPs
  - low genome resquecing with about 0.7 coverage
- *[Oryza sativa](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10532)*
  - A total of **1,568** rice accessions and **700,000** SNPs.
  - using micro-array technology
