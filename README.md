# GWAS-in-Crop-Species
Simulate GWAS in different speices under vairous situations including number of QTNs, effect values, and heritability. 
Wiiiie collected several crop spieceis genotype data from published paper:
- *[Sorghum bicolor](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/6/e1400218.short)*
  including **1,943** georeferenced landraces and **404,627** SNPs
- *[Setaria italica](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n8/abs/ng.2673.html)*
  including **916** diverse varieties and **726,080** SNPs
